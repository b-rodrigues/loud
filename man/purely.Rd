\title{Capture all errors, warnings and messages}
\usage{
purely(.f, strict = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{.f}{A function to decorate}

\item{strict}{Controls if the decorated function should catch only errors (1), errors and warnings (2, the default) or errors, warnings and messages (3)}
}
\value{
A function which returns a list. The first element of the list, $value, is the result of
the original function .f applied to its inputs. The second element, $log is NULL in case everything
goes well. In case of error/warning/message, $value is NA and $log holds the message.
purely() is used by loudly() to allow the latter to handle errors.
}

Capture all errors, warnings and messages
}
\examples{
purely(log)(10)
purely(log)(-10)
purely(log, strict = 1)(-10) # This produces a warning, so with strict = 1 nothing gets captured.
}
